This module requires that MPFR (and hence GMP) has been installed.
It wraps the 'mpfr-2.1.0' (floating point) functions. You'll get errors
if you try to build Math-MPFR-1.04 (or later) against an earlier 
version of the mpfr library. If you have an earlier version of the 
mpfr library, try Math-MPFR-1.03 (or earlier, if necessary). 
See http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/ for MPFR source and
instructions on how to build the library - or see below for how to
obtain Win32 pre-compiled Math::MPFR binaries.

For GMP, see http://swox.com/gmp .

To build this module you need perl 5.6.0 or later. I'm not sure of all
the requirements to get it to build with earlier versions of perl, but
it's definite that the XS code relating to operator overloading will 
not compile with perl versions prior to 5.6.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

When building this module, the following files from the GMP and MPFR
libraries will need to be accessible:

 gmp.h
 mpfr.h
 the static library files libgmp and libmpfr ('.a' or '.lib')

If those files are in a location where your compiler does not find 
them by default, then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL', you'll
need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/gmp_include -I/path/to/mpfr_includes" LIBS="-L/path/to/mpfr_lib -L/path/to/gmp_lib -lmpfr -lgmp"

(Alternatively you could copy the requisite files to a location where
the compiler *does* find them by default - which was the option I 
chose on Win32.)

If you have a dynamic build of GMP, then the GMP shared library file 
('.dll' or '.so') needs to be accessible to the system.

Win32 pre-compiled binaries (with installation instructions) of 
this module can be found at:
http://www.kalinabears.com.au/w32perl/math_gnump.html . 
Using the pre-compiled perl binaries is the best option for MSVC built
perl (including ActiveState perl).
